                  Article II<br> Board of Directors
              </td>
              <td class="laws-right">
                  <strong>General Powers</strong>. Except as set forth in the statutes of the State of Oregon, the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, all corporate powers of the corporation will be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of the corporation managed under the direction of, the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will exercise the powers of the corporation and manage the business and affairs of the corporation in accordance with Sections 1.3 and 1.4.
                  <br> <strong>Number, Class and Term</strong>. The number of Directors will be composed of not less than 3 nor more than 15 Directors, the specific number to be set by resolution of the Board of Directors. The minimum and maximum number of Directors may be changed from time to time by amendment to these Bylaws, but no decrease in the number of Directors will have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent Director. The term of office of the directors will expire at the next annual meeting following the organizational meeting at which they are elected. At each annual meeting after the organizational meeting, directors will be elected for a term of one year to succeed the directors whose terms expire at such meeting. Despite the expiration of a Director&rsquo;s term, each Director will continue to serve until the Director&rsquo;s successor is appointed and qualifies or until there is a decrease in the number of Directors and the Director is not re-appointed.
                  <br> <strong>Election of Directors</strong>. The initial Board of Directors shall be those individuals named at the organizational meeting, and they shall serve until the first annual meeting or until their successors are elected. At each annual meeting of the directors shall be elected to serve until the next annual meeting or until their successors are elected. Number of Directors may be increased at any regular meeting of the Board of Directors by the majority vote of all the directors then on the Board of Directors. The new director will serve until the next annual meeting or until the director&rsquo;s successor is elected.
                  <br> <strong>Resignation</strong>. A Director may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the Board of Directors or the corporation. A resignation is effective when the notice is received by the Board of Directors or the corporation unless the notice specifies a later effective date. Once delivered, a notice of resignation is irrevocable unless revocation is permitted by the Board of Directors.
                  <br> <strong>Removal</strong>. A two-thirds majority of the Board of Directors may at any time remove one or more Directors with or without cause; provided, however, that a Director may be removed by the Board of Directors only at a Board of Directors meeting called for the purpose of removing the Director and the meeting notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is removal of the Director.
                  <br> <strong>Vacancies</strong>.  A vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors shall be filled at a special meeting of the Board of Directors called for that purpose by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, though the remaining directors are less than a quorum. The new director shall serve only the predecessor&rsquo;s unexpired term.
                  <br> <strong>Standard of Conduct</strong>.

                      <li>
                          A Director will discharge the duties of a Director, including the Director&rsquo;s duties as a member of a Committee:
                          <ol>
                            <li>In good faith;</li>
                            <li>With the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances; and</li>
                            <li>In a manner the Director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation.</li>
                          </ol>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          In discharging the duties of a Director, a Director is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by:
                          <ol>
                            <li>One or more Officers or employees of the corporation whom the Director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;</li>
                            <li>Legal counsel, public accountants or other persons as to matters the Director reasonably believes are within the person&rsquo;s professional or expert competence; or</li>
                            <li>A Committee of the Board of Directors of which the Director is not a member, as to matters within its jurisdiction, if the Director reasonably believes the Committee merits confidence.</li>
                          </ol>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          A Director is not acting in good faith if the Director has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by Section 2.7(b) unwarranted.
                      </li>
                      </ul>
                      <strong>Conflicts of Interest</strong>.</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>If a Director knows or reasonably believes that a conflict of interest transaction in which the Director has a direct or indirect interest is to be discussed or voted on at a meeting, the Director will, either prior to or at the meeting, disclose fully to the Board of Directors or to a Committee of the Board of Directors the material facts of the transaction and the Director&rsquo;s interest in the transaction.</li>
                            <li>A conflict of interest transaction may be approved by the vote of the Board of Directors or a Committee of the Board of Directors if the material facts of the transaction and the Director&rsquo;s interest in the transaction are disclosed fully or known to the Board of Directors or Committee of the Board of Directors. A conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved and ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction; provided, however, a conflict of interest transaction may not be authorized, approved or ratified by less than two (2) Directors. If a majority of the Directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction votes to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purposes of taking action under this Section 2.8(b). The presence of, or vote cast by, a Director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction will not affect the validity of any action taken if the transaction is otherwise approved as provided in this Section 2.8(b).</li>
                            <li>A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable and may not be the basis for imposing liability on a Director if the transaction was entered into or is approved as provided in Section 2.8(b).</li>
                            <li>A &ldquo;<strong>conflict of interest</strong>&rdquo; transaction is a transaction with the corporation in which a Director has a direct or indirect interest (whether financial or otherwise and whether actual or potential).</li>
                            <li>A Director has an &ldquo;<strong>indirect interest</strong>&rdquo; in a transaction if (i) a family member of the Director is a party to the transaction, (ii) another entity in which the Director has a material interest is a party to the transaction, or (iii) another entity of which the Director is a director, officer or trustee is a party to the transaction, and the transaction is or should be considered by the Board of Directors.</li>
                            <li>A &ldquo;<strong>family member</strong>&rdquo; of an individual will include the individual&rsquo;s brothers and sisters (whether by whole blood or half blood), spouse, ancestors, lineal descendants and in-laws of any of the foregoing. A legally adopted child of an individual will be treated as a child of such individual by blood.</li>
                          </ul>
                        <strong>Liability</strong>. No Director will be personally liable to the corporation or the members, if any, for monetary damages for conduct as a Director; provided, however, that this Section 2.9 will not eliminate or limit the liability of a Director for (i) any act or omission occurring prior to the effective date of these Bylaws, (ii) any breach of the Director&rsquo;s duty of loyalty to the corporation, (iii) acts or omissions not in good faith which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iv) any unlawful distribution, (v) any transaction from which the Director derived an improper personal benefit, and (vi) any act or omission in violation of ORS 65.361 to ORS 65.367.
                        <br><strong>Compensation</strong>. No Director will receive any compensation for services rendered as a Director. The corporation may, in its sole discretion, reimburse a Director for any reasonable expenses incurred by the Director in connection with the attendance of any meeting.

                    <strong>Telephone Meetings</strong>. The Board of Directors may permit any or all Directors to participate in a regular or special meeting by, or conduct the meeting through, use of any means of communication by which all Directors participating may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting. A Director participating in a meeting by this means is deemed to be present in person at the meeting.  <br>
                    <strong>Action Without a Meeting</strong>. Action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all member of the Board of Directors.

                 <br><strong>Removal</strong>.	 Any officer, agent or other employee elected or appointed by the Board of Directors, may be removed by a majority vote of all the directors then serving on the board whenever in their judgment the best interests of the Corporation will be served thereby.

The president shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and shall be the inspector of all elections of directors and certify those who are elected as such.

             <td class="laws-right">
                    <strong>Contracts</strong>. Except as provided otherwise by law or these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may authorize any Officers, employees or agents to enter into any contract or execute and deliver any instrument in the name and on behalf of the corporation, and such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized, no Officer, employee or agent will have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or agreement or to pledge the corporation&rsquo;s credit to render it liable for any purpose or to any amount.
                    <strong>Loans</strong>. No money shall be borrowed by the Corporation without authority of the Board of Directors, and for security purposes, the Board of Directors may authorize the execution and delivery of a mortgage or trust deed upon any of the real property belonging to the Corporation or the pledging of any of the personal property of the corporation. Such authorization having been given, the president or vice president of the corporation, in conjunction with the secretary or treasurer, shall execute in the name of the corporation the authorized notes, mortgages, trust deeds and pledges.
                    <strong>Checks and Drafts</strong>. All checks, drafts or other orders for the payment of money and notes or other evidences of indebtedness issued in the name of the corporation will be signed by such Officers, employees or agents of the corporation as from time to time will be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.
                    <strong>Deposits</strong>. All funds of the corporation not otherwise employed will be deposited from time to time to the credit of the corporation in such banks, trust companies or other depositories as the Board of Directors may select.
                    <strong>Effectiveness of Notice</strong>. Wherever notice is required in these Bylaws, such notice may be oral or written unless otherwise specified for a particular kind of notice. Notice may be communicated in person, by telephone, telegraph, teletype or other form of wire or wireless communication, by mail or private carrier, including publication in a newsletter or similar document mailed to a director&rsquo;s address. Personal written notice, if in a comprehensible form, is effective at the earliest of the following: when received; five days after its postmark, if mailed by United States mail correctly addressed and with first class postage affixed; on the date shown on the return receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and the receipt is signed by or on behalf of the addressee; or 30 days after its deposit in the United States mail if mailed correctly addressed and with other than first class, registered or certified postage affixed.
                    <strong>Waiver of Notice</strong>. A director may at any time waive any notice required by these Bylaws, the Articles of Incorporation or the Oregon Nonprofit Corporation Act. The waiver must be in writing, be signed by the director entitled to the notice, specify the meeting for which the notice is waived and be filed with the minutes or corporate records. A director&rsquo;s attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to the director of the meeting unless the director, at the beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon the director&rsquo;s arrival, objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to any action taken at the meeting. Whenever any notice is required to be given to any director under the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the required notice. The presence of a director at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of any notice required for such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

                    <strong>Directors and Officers</strong>. The corporation will indemnify its Directors and Officers who are made, or threatened to be made, parties to a proceeding by reason of the fact that the person is or was a Director or Officer of the corporation, for uninsured liability incurred by such persons as a result of such proceedings, to the fullest extent permitted by the Act, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of alleged occurrences of actions or omissions preceding any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than the Act permitted the corporation to provide prior to such amendment).
                    <strong>Employees and Other Agents</strong>. The corporation may indemnify an employee or other agent who is made, or threatened to be made, a party to a proceeding by reason of the fact that the person is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, for uninsured liability incurred by such person as a result of such proceeding.
                    <strong>No Presumption of Bad Faith</strong>. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent will not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that the person had reasonable cause to believe that its conduct was unlawful.
                    <strong>Insurance</strong>. To the fullest extent permitted by the Act, the corporation, upon approval by the Board of Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Article VIII or any contract. Any obligation or authorization of the corporation for payment of indemnity or advancement of expenses to or on behalf of a Director, Officer, employee, or other agent pursuant to any provision in this or other documents will be extinguished to the extent there is enforceable insurance coverage for the same expenses or liabilities. If insurance coverage is disputed, the corporation will advance any expenses and other payments required by this Article VIII upon assignment of the claim against the insurer for failure to provide or pay such amounts.
