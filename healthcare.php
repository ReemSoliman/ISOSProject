 <h2 class="pageTitle">Health Care</h2>

 <p class="smaller" style="text-align:justify">As you confronted the cultural and psychological challenges in providing Medical Treatment and its support services, let&rsquo;s remind you that as human beings we share more in common
 than we do differences.  According to the Laws and Traditions of Islam we wish the peace and mercy of God for you. <br><br>
  Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world and is the second largest religion in the world now. Still very few hospitals, outside Muslim countries, 
  where Muslims can receive Medical care according to the Laws and Traditions of Islam.  <br> <br>
  In the Greater Portland Metropolitan area alone there are about 20,000  Muslims &ndash; Muslims of every race and ethnicity &ndash;
  every color &ndash; every age. Most large cities and some of the smaller ones, in Oregon have significant populations of Muslims. 
  While Muslims tend to live around the Mosques and in communities with concentrations of Muslims,
  some live in areas isolated from other Muslims but still practice their religion.<br>  <br>
  In response to providing health care information to the medical care society, Islamic Social Services of Oregon State (ISOS) &ndash; 
  has generated a handbook and brochure for health providers when treating Muslim patients (see links below). 
  The goal is to provide you with a basic understanding of Islam and with information necessary to provide Medical and auxiliary services for care under the Laws and Traditions of Islam. For this purpose, we have divided the handbook into three sections..<br> <br>
  <strong>Section One</strong> deals with a basic understanding of our religion, to provide you with accurate information and, give you the rational for
  the specifics of Medical Treatment that may differ for us.<br> <br>
  <strong>Section Two</strong> will provide you with the specific requirements of Islamic Medical Care, thus you will learn what is and is not
  allowed and how they affect your treatment of the patient.<br><br>
  <strong>Section Three</strong> deals with the most frequently questions asked.<br><br>
  We hope this will be a good learning experience for you. We encourage your questions. We are available to you to answer any question you have.
